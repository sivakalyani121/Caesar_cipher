# **Caesar Cipher Program**
This Python program provides a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

# **Features**
Encrypt a Message: Convert your plaintext message into a cipher text by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions.
Decrypt a Message: Convert your cipher text back into plaintext by reversing the shift.
User Interaction: The program allows users to continuously encrypt or decrypt messages until they choose to exit.

# **How to Use?**
# Choose an Operation:
Type 'encrypt' for encryption.
Type 'decrypt' for decryption.
Enter Your Message:
Provide the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. The program automatically converts it to lowercase to simplify processing.
Enter the Shift Key:
Specify a number for the shift key, which determines how many positions each letter will be shifted in the alphabet.
View the Result:
The program outputs the encrypted or decrypted message based on your choice.
Continue or Exit:
After viewing the result, you can choose to continue encrypting/decrypting more messages or exit the program.
